Description:
    The custom_layout generator creates a nice html5 layout.
    It replaces the existing default layout build by the scaffold generator.

    The generator takes one argument which will be the name of the theme 
    to apply If no argument is passed then it defaults to "black_mamba".

Example:
    rails generate custom_layout

    This will create:
        app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
        + theme's files
